# CS584DataStructures
Research project for PSU CS 584, Spring 2018.

This repository contains the files pertaining to my research project for Portland State University's CS 584 - Graduate Algorithm Design & Analysis. I experiment with various data structures that maintain total ordering to compare their performance to one another and to their asymptotic performance. The culminating deliverable is the project report, available in this repository as [Report.tex](./Report.tex) and [Report.pdf](Report.pdf).

This project was produced using JetBrains PyCharm and ShareLaTeX/Overleaf.
