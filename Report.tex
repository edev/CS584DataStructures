\maketitle

\paragraph{Project topic} I will implement a variety of data structures that maintain total orders on their data, e.g. 2-3 trees, treaps, and skip lists; I will choose at least one deterministic structure as a reference and at least one randomized data structure for comparison. I will experimentally evaluate the rates of growth of their run times for insertions, searches, and deletions. Based on these data, I will discuss how the performance I observe compares to the predicted asymptotic performance.

\section{Introduction}
This paper aims to illuminate various facets of the relationship between asymptotic complexity and empirical performance of a range of related data structures. The vehicle for this exploration is a series of benchmarks of data structures that perform similar jobs in very different ways. These include binary search trees, treaps, and skip lists \todo{FINALIZE LIST OF DATA STRUCTURES}. For many tasks, they have the same asymptotic complexity, e.g. average complexity of $O(\log n)$ for search, insert, and delete operations, with worst-case complexity of $O(n)$ for each. This paper examines the performance characteristics of each and investigates how comparable the performance characteristics of these asymptotically equivalent data structures really are.

\section{Testing Methodology}
Gathering reliable data is, of course, of paramount importance to any data-based analysis. Since the analysis in this paper is based on benchmark data, the accuracy of the analysis hinges on the accuracy of the benchmarks themselves. The benchmarks included in this paper utilize the following measures to help ensure their accuracy:

\begin{itemize}
    \item To minimize the impact of timer error, CPU load spikes, and so on, each data point is the average running time of a large number of operations $k$, where $k \geq 100$.
    \item To minimize the impact of such large values of $k$, the overall sample sizes are suitably large, such that $n \geq 100 \cdot k$, where $n$ is the size of a data structure when the $k$ timed operations begin. In other words, the number of operations being timed is no larger than 1\% of the overall data structure at any point.
    \item When necessary for accuracy, multiple passes may be combined by taking the median or mean time of the running times for each value of $n$ being plotted.
    \item Since these benchmarks are highly sensitive to fluctuating operating conditions (e.g. CPU scheduling, RAM availability, and Python interpreter behavior), each benchmark produces multiple graphs. The most representative graph among the set is chosen for inclusion in this paper.
    \item To prevent human error in transcribing graphs or plot data, all graphs are generated programmatically using the same function and included without modification (except to specify each graph's placement and size).
    \item All tests are performed on the same computer, an Intel i7-4930k with 16 GB of DDR3 running at 2133 MHz. The CPU is water-cooled to prevent thermal throttling and overclocked beyond its Turbo frequency, which should further stabilize the benchmark results.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Note that some of the graphs under \todo{TESTING DATA STRUCTURES SECTION NAME} necessarily disobey the above guidelines.}

\section{Project Files}
The Python 3 implementations included with this report are structured as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item datastructures/ --- contains the implementations of data structures benchmarked below, one per file.
    \item plots/ --- contains the output \LaTeX \ figures that the benchmark system produces, ready to \\include.
    \item pgfplot.py --- contains the PgfPlot class, which represents one \LaTeX \ figure to be produced. This class receives and stores all parameters that affect the figure, including plots to be produced.
    \item plot.py --- contains the Plot and BenchmarkPlot classes, which represent plots in a PGFPLOT graph. The Plot class may be used to produce arbitrary plots, whereas the BenchmarkPlot class receives benchmark parameters for one function and produces the corresponding plot.
    \item benchmark.py --- sets up and runs the benchmarks used in this document by creating PgfPlot objects and running them.
\end{itemize}

To run custom benchmarks, simply follow the examples in benchmark.py. All classes are thoroughly documented and commented.

\section{Data Structure Implementations}
The data structures in question are well-known, so many implementations exist. This paper examines the data structure implementations below, marked by the files or subfolders they occupy within datastructures/ in the project files. All credit for each implementation goes to the author of that implementation. All data structures used are cited here. Modifications are annotated in source comments.

\end{itemize}

The above data structures have been modified as needed to standardize their interfaces for insert, search, and delete operations.

\section{Data Structure Selection}
The first step in analyzing these data structures is to establish a baseline for their performance. This provides an opportunity to rule out any implementations that are too slow to consider. First, a benchmark on element insertion with only a few hundred elements reveals an outlier:

\input{plots/randomAllMiniscule.tex}

Clearly Pyskip is too slow for further consideration. In fact, I began with a 105-million-element benchmark that my reference BST implementation handled in about a minute. Pyskip took so long that I eventually had to cancel the benchmark. I had to pare the initial benchmark down to below 1,000 elements to achieve a running time that would not dwarf the rest of my benchmarks combined. With Pyskip eliminated, a graph with larger (But still quite modest) data sets presents a clearer picture of the comparability of the various data structures with random inputs:

\input{plots/randomAllSmall.tex}
