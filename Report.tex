\maketitle

\paragraph{Project topic} I will implement a variety of data structures that maintain total orders on their data, e.g. 2-3 trees, treaps, and skip lists; I will choose at least one deterministic structure as a reference and at least one randomized data structure for comparison. I will experimentally evaluate the rates of growth of their run times for insertions, searches, and deletions. Based on these data, I will discuss how the performance I observe compares to the predicted asymptotic performance.

\section{Introduction}
This paper aims to illuminate various facets of the relationship between asymptotic complexity and empirical performance. The vehicle for this exploration is a series of benchmarks of data structures that perform similar jobs in very different ways. These include \todo{LIST OF DATA STRUCTURES}. For many tasks, they have the same asymptotic complexity, e.g. average complexity of $O(\log n)$ for search, insert, and delete operations, with worst-case complexity of $O(n)$ for each. This paper examines the performance characteristics of each and investigates how comparable the performance characteristics of these asymptotically equivalent data structures really are.

\section{Testing Methodology}

The core of the analysis in this paper is a collection of data sets gathered through benchmarking. Thus, it is essential to establish a reliable testing methodology, enforced through automation, to gather accurate data and ensure the integrity of the analysis that follows.

\section{Data Structure Selection}
Many implementations exist for each of these data structures, since they are well-known.
