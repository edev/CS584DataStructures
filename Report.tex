\maketitle

\paragraph{Project topic} I will implement a variety of data structures that maintain total orders on their data, e.g. 2-3 trees, treaps, and skip lists; I will choose at least one deterministic structure as a reference and at least one randomized data structure for comparison. I will experimentally evaluate the rates of growth of their runAndWrite times for insertions, searches, and deletions. Based on these data, I will discuss how the performance I observe compares to the predicted asymptotic performance.

\section{Introduction}
This paper aims to illuminate various facets of the relationship between asymptotic complexity and empirical performance of a range of related data structures. The vehicle for this exploration is a series of benchmarks of data structures that perform similar jobs in very different ways. These include binary search trees, treaps, skip lists, and red-black trees \todo{ADD ANY NEW DATA STRUCTURES HERE}. For many tasks, they have the same asymptotic complexity, e.g. average complexity of $O(\log n)$ for search, insert, and delete operations, with worst-case complexity of $O(n)$ for each. However, the binary search tree in particular has well-known best- and worst-case inputs. Balanced trees like the red-black tree are designed to mitigate these worst-case input scenarios by ensuring a balanced tree structure. The randomized treap and skip list data structures, on the other hand, rely on different randomization techniques to maintain fast expected performance with a tree and a list structure, respectively. These different approaches to potential worst-case inputs will make for interesting comparisons across the board. This paper examines the performance characteristics of each data structure through careful benchmarks and asks how comparable the performance characteristics of these asymptotically equivalent data structures really are.

\section{Testing Methodology}
Gathering reliable data is, of course, of paramount importance to any data-based analysis. Since the analysis in this paper is based on benchmark data, the accuracy of the analysis hinges on the accuracy of the benchmarks themselves. The benchmarks included in this paper utilize the following measures to help ensure their accuracy:

\begin{itemize}
    \item To minimize the impact of timer error, CPU load spikes, and so on, each data point is the average running time of a large number of operations $k$, where $k \geq 100$.
    \item To minimize the impact of such large values of $k$, the overall sample sizes are suitably large, such that $n \geq 100 \cdot k$, where $n$ is the size of a data structure when the $k$ timed operations begin. In other words, the number of operations being timed is no larger than 1\% of the overall data structure at any point.
    \item When necessary for accuracy, multiple passes may be combined by taking the median or mean time of the running times for each value of $n$ being plotted.
    \item Since these benchmarks are highly sensitive to fluctuating operating conditions (e.g. CPU scheduling, RAM availability, and Python interpreter behavior), each benchmark produces multiple graphs. The most representative graph among the set is chosen for inclusion in this paper.
    \item To prevent human error in transcribing graphs or plot data, all graphs are generated programmatically using the same function and included without modification (except to specify each graph's placement and size).
    \item All tests are performed on the same computer, an Intel i7-4930k with 16 GB of DDR3 running at 2133 MHz. The CPU is water-cooled to prevent thermal throttling and overclocked beyond its Turbo frequency, which should further stabilize the benchmark results.
    \item Random samples are chosen by shuffling integers in the range [0, $n$), where $n$ is the number of samples required. This prevents repeated values, which means that there are no repeated keys within any data structure. This is important for benchmarking searches and deletes, since they will act on the first matching key they find: multiple keys would skew these benchmarks in potentially unpredictable ways.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Note that some of the graphs under \todo{TESTING DATA STRUCTURES SECTION NAME} necessarily disobey the above guidelines.}

\section{Project Files}
The Python 3 implementations included with this report are structured as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item datastructures/ --- contains the implementations of data structures benchmarked below, one per file.
    \item plots/ --- contains the output \LaTeX \ figures that the benchmark system produces, ready to \\include.
    \item pgfplot.py --- contains the PgfPlot class, which represents one \LaTeX \ figure to be produced. This class receives and stores all parameters that affect the figure, including plots to be produced.
    \item plot.py --- contains the Plot and BenchmarkPlot classes, which represent plots in a PGFPLOT graph. The Plot class may be used to produce arbitrary plots, whereas the BenchmarkPlot class receives benchmark parameters for one function and produces the corresponding plot.
    \item benchmark.py --- sets up and runs the benchmarks used in this document by creating PgfPlot objects and running them.
    \todo{Update me: pfgplot, plot, sidwhatever, ...}
\end{itemize}

To run custom benchmarks, simply follow the examples in benchmark.py. All classes are thoroughly documented and commented.

\section{Data Structure Implementations}

This paper examines the data structure implementations below, marked by the files or subfolders they occupy within datastructures/ in the project files. All credit for each implementation goes to the author of that implementation. All data structures used are cited here. Modifications are annotated in source comments.

\end{itemize}

The above data structures have been modified as needed to standardize their interfaces for insert, search, and delete operations.

\section{Choosing Implementations to Test}
The first step in analyzing these data structures is to establish a baseline for their performance. This provides an opportunity to rule out any implementations that are too slow to consider (as well as a disappointing number of incorrect implementations found along the way---not included here). First, a benchmark on element insertion with only a few hundred elements reveals an outlier:

\input{plots/randomAllMiniscule.tex}

Clearly Pyskip is too slow for further consideration. In fact, I began with a 105-million-element benchmark that my reference BST implementation handled in about a minute. Pyskip took so long that I eventually had to cancel the benchmark. I had to pare the initial benchmark down to below 1,000 elements to achieve a running time that would not dwarf the rest of my benchmarks combined. With Pyskip eliminated, a graph with larger (but still quite modest) data sets presents a clearer picture of the comparability of the various data structures with random inputs:

\input{plots/randomAllSmall.tex}

Based on these benchmark results, the only remaining skiplist implementation is again the clear outlier, but in this case, the difference is much less pronounced. Compared to the binary search tree reference implementation, PySkipList benchmarks on insertion at only about 2.5 times slower, and this, of course, is under ideal conditions for a binary search tree.

Comparing the Stromberg and Jenks treaps, the latter appears to be two or three times faster in this particular benchmark. Interestingly, both are comparable or superior to the binary search tree, and the Jenks treap is faster than both the binary search tree and the Kozlovski red-black tree! Because the treaps provide such interesting counterpoints, both to one another and to the deterministic data structures used here, I will keep both. Thus, the data structures are finalized.

\section{Choosing Inputs \& Benchmarks}
The remainder of this paper examines the above implementations' performance on the insert, search, and delete operations with large data sets ($10^6$ or larger). The two essential cases are randomized input and ordered input (the binary search tree's worst-case input). Beyond these, I will add as many more novel configurations as space allows.

The SIDGraphSet and SIDBenchmark classes in sidgraphset.py perform the first two benchmark sets\todo{update this}. Their sequence, in short, is to perform insertions up to each data point, benchmark searches on selected elements that have already been inserted, benchmark insertions, and repeat. Once all insertions are complete, the sequence continues with deletions: SIDBenchmark will delete elements until it reaches the last graph point plus the sample size, benchmark deletions to the graph plot point, and continue in this way until it benchmarks the first plot point. \todo{Update this to reflect any additional benchmarks.}

\section{Benchmarks: Randomized Inputs}
Random inputs are, of course, the best-case scenario for binary search tree insertions. The other data structures should perform well on randomized inputs, too. As a result, this benchmark serves as a useful baseline for later comparisons. The average-case asymptotic performance for all four data structures is $O(\log n)$, and I expect this performance from all five implementations with this input set.

\input{plots/random_search.tex}

Search is perhaps the most interesting graph, because, surprisingly, the graphs of the five plots all curve to plausibly match the graph of $c \cdot \log n$ for various constant multiples $c$. Clearly, all five do in fact work in logarithmic time! (Author's note: very cool!) Both treaps are the clear winners for search. PySkipList, the slowest implementation in the small data set benchmark above, is neck-and-neck with the binary search tree. Finally, the red-black tree, the second-fastest on insertion in the small data set benchmark, is the standout slowest here.

\input{plots/random_insert.tex}

Next up is insertion. Here, the logarithmic graph is faintly visible at best. The most telling is perhaps the binary search tree, whose running time approximately doubles from $10^5$ elements to $10^6$ elements, in keeping with a logarithmic rate of growth.  In comparison to the small data set insertion benchmark, almost everything is the same: the treaps and red-black tree are all tightly grouped, and PySkipList takes about twice as long as the rest. However, in this best-case input for the binary search tree, it does indeed pull ahead of the pack.

\input{plots/random_delete.tex}

Finally, delete performance is almost entirely flat across all five graphs. It is stratified into two groups, but on closer inspection, these are easily explained. Binary search trees and treaps both enjoy relatively simple insertions and deletions, whereas red-black trees and skip lists \todo{confirm this} may require much more work for both.

\section{Benchmarks: Ordered Inputs}

The worst-case scenarios for binary search trees are inserting ordered data, deleting the farthest leaf, and searching for the lowest data in the tree. In any of these cases, the worst-case performance is $O(n)$. Since treaps, skiplists, and red-black trees all claim to run in $O(\log n)$ expected time in these scenarioes, these worst-case inputs are the next logical benchmark. To briefly illustrate the performance difference between the binary search tree and all the other data structures, see the mini-graphs with the binary search tree clearly dwarfing the other data structures and performing in linear time. This is expected and needs no further discussion. (Note that for these graphs, the benchmark parameters were adjusted: the normal 180 million overall searches, insertions, and deletions would take unreasonably long and provide no noticeable benefit in terms of graph quality.)

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \input{plots/worstCase_search.tex}
    \input{plots/worstCase_insert.tex}
    \input{plots/worstCase_delete.tex}
    \caption{Average of 100 operations, benchmarked every 500, starting at 500.}
\end{figure}

The more interesting graphs appear when the binary search tree is removed from the data set, as appears below. Here, same worst-case inputs for binary search trees create minor challenges for the various data structures, as they cope in their own ways with the ordered input data. By removing the binary search tree, the benchmarks can once again run at their full scales without issue, which already demonstrates their power to cope with difficult input sets.

\input{plots/worstCaseNoBST_search.tex}

The first graph, search, presents a great deal more noise than the randomized input search benchmarks. This, I attribute simply to the challenges and inefficiencies inherent in coping with sorted inputs to these data structures. The specifics are surprising and don't seem to have simple explanations. The two treaps perform almost identically, in contrast with the marked performance difference on search with randomized inputs. This suggests that ordered inputs to insert may cause the trees to develop more similar geometries than random inputs. PySkipList is by far the noisiest on search, which suggests a high degree of unpredictability in its performance, even as it maintains logarithmic complexity overall. Lastly, the red-black tree is consistent but slower than the rest. 

The relative speeds of the three data structures remain unchanged: the treaps are fastest, the skiplist is significantly slower, and the red-black tree is slower still. While these are not provable general statements about the three data structures, they do provide insight into the impact of ordered inputs (to both insert and search) on the performance of searches, which is to say that the data structures are only very modestly affected. Finally, it is worth noting that, compared to search with randomized inputs, the red-black tree and Stromberg treap are both noticeably slower, whereas the Jenks treap and PySkipList remain about the same in their overall speeds.

\input{plots/worstCaseNoBST_insert.tex}

Insert on ordered data presents a more interesting picture still. First, the red-black tree, whose performance on random data sat squarely between the two treaps, is now in last place by a wide margin. This makes sense: sorted input is a worst-case scenario for red-black trees, too, because they will need to rotate almost constantly to maintain balance. Yet, it remains clearly and visibly $O(\log n)$ even in this case---an impressive feat. Being deterministic, it exhibits very smooth worst-case performance, but it is indeed far slower than its randomized counterparts.

The remaining three data structures are plagued by differing levels of noise, but their relative performance is essentially unchanged compared to the randomized input insert benchmark. The most noteworthy aspect of their performance is perhaps the consistency of Jenks relative to Stromberg. While Stromberg straddles the line its randomized benchmark cut, with wide and erratic variations in running time, Jenks is quite consistent.

\input{plots/worstCaseNoBST_delete.tex}

Delete is much the same story: worst-case but very consistent performance for the red-black tree, while the randomized data structures have some noise but are still relatively consistent. Again, Jenks is much more stable than Stromberg in its running times.

\section{Conclusions}
The reality of how slow $O(n)$ can be compared to $O(\log n)$ hit me clearly during the worst-case benchmarking of the binary search tree. In CS 584, we consider any polynomial time algorithm to be feasibly runnable, but for these (admittedly very large) input sizes, even linear brought my very powerful workstation to a grinding halt with a single binary tree benchmark sequence that, under ideal circumstances, had taken about a minute to complete. 

An implementation by Dmitry Sysoev of the textbook's red-black tree algorithm would have made for an even more interesting counterpoint: on insert, with random data, it had proved to be the fastest algorithm. Unfortunately, its deletion method was fatally flawed, partly due to design decisions by the textbook authors that made their algorithm very difficult to implement correctly. I was not able to fix the Sysoev implementation in the time available for this project, so I excluded it from the analysis instead.

Overall, the picture these benchmarks paint is clear: both treap implementations are quite fast, Pyskip is relatively slow by comparison, and the red-black tree loses out to the randomized data structures in its worst case (while only tying the treaps in the best). Based on this paper, of the algorithms presented, treaps are the clear winner.
